## Project description
This project was a part of my schools JavaScript course. We developed the project using Gitea(this was our school's choice of VCS) and that's why the commit history is pretty empty.
Me and my school colleagues made a facebook-like social network.

## Run the project
To test the project you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
1. Start frontend server by going to **/frontend** directory and running those commands
-  `npm run serve`
-  `npm install`
2. Start backend server by going to **/backend** directory and run `go run server.go`

## What I did
I created the design of the project using Figma and then used that to create the HTML and CSS for our project. I created notifications and chat system and rest of the stuff regarding frontend we did together with my front-end partner Vic.
