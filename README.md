## Project description
This project was a part of my schools JavaScript course.
Me and my school colleagues made a facebook-like social network that contains the following features:
- Followers
- Profiles
- Posts
- Groups
- Notifications
- Chats
- 
Since we used Gitea in school, I couldnt keep the commit history.

## Run the project
To test the project you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
1. Start frontend server by going to **/frontend** directory and running those commands
-  `npm run serve`
-  `npm install`
2. Start backend server by going to **/backend** directory and run `go run server.go`




## Stack
I created the whole design of the project. I started by creating the design in Figma and then translating that into code. I worked solo on Notifications and Chats. Rest of the stuff we did together with my front-end partner Vic.
